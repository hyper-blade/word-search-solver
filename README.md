# word-search-solver
A simple C++ program to solve word search puzzles.

# How to Use
Enter the puzzle line by line into `puzzle.txt`, then enter the words line by line into `words.txt`. Finally, compile and run `main.cpp` within a shell, as it closes immediately otherwise. `puzzle.txt` and `words.txt` contain a demonstration puzzle and word set each.
